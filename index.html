 <h3>who am i here</h3>

 <p> Hello, my name is Arijus. At this point I do doctorate studies at <a href="https://team.inria.fr/magnet/team-members/">Magnet</a> which is a research team in <a href="lille.jpg">Lille</a>. People in Magnet would in some way do computing science through decentralised learning, privacy, natural language processing, graphs... </p>
 <p> I work with Jan Ramon. At this point here I study random structures which could be practical in designing decentralised communication networks.

 <h3>how did i get here</h3>

 <p> Before Lille I worked on Bayesian methods at Aalto. Before that in 2017 I received my master's degree in computing science and mathematics from Glasgow. And in 2012 I got my Brandos Atestatas from the Juozas Balčikonis gymnasium, <a href="http://sinemateka.lt/en/#">Panevėžys</a>. </p>

 <h3>who have i worked with</h3> 

 <ul>

  <li> Andrew Hoskins asked at what extent anyone could collect images of war from social media.<br><i><font size="2">Arijus Pleska, Andrew Hoskins, Karen Renaud. A Framework for Interrogating Social Images to Reveal an Emergent Archive of Modern War. IJHAC: A Journal of the Digital Humanities. To appear Spring 2019</font></i>
  </li>

  <li> Bayesian optimisation is what Marko Järvenpää showed me at Aalto.<br><i><font size="2">Marko Järvenpää, Michael U. Gutmann, Arijus Pleska, Aki Vehtari, and Pekka Marttinen. "Efficient acquisition rules for model-based approximate Bayesian computation." Bayesian Analysis (2018)</font></i>
  </li>

  <li> <a href="https://github.com/elfi-dev/elfi"> https://github.com/elfi-dev/elfi</a> is a library for approximate Bayesian computations, where Henri Vuollekoski and I put Marko's idea.
  </li>

  <li> Topic models in mass spectrometry imaging is what Simon Rogers helped with for the master's.<br><i><font size="2">Arijus Pleska. "Spatial Smoothing in Mass Spectrometry Imaging." (2017).</font></i>
  </li>
